# pathgame

The logic for this path game was made as a part of Programming 2 course in Tampere University. The UI for the project was developed after the course.

The instructions to play: 
* The purpose is to move green and red buttons such that finally they are in opposite places than at the beginning. 
* Assuming that at the beginning, the green buttons are at the top and the red ones at the bottom, the aim is to reach the situation where green buttons are at the bottom and the red ones at the top.
* It is not allowed to move a button over another one, but the moves are made along a path of empty places. A move can be as long as there is such kind of path.

The environment required to run the application is QT Creator version 6.1.1 or higher and the compiler for C++. The project can be run with path2.pro project file.
